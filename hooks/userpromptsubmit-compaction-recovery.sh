# thread-spawn subagent gets no start hook after compaction, so its recovery has
# to ride on the next prompt instead. Parent messages reach a subagent as user
# input, so this hook runs there. The marker is consumed once, so a root thread
# that already recovered at SessionStart falls through as a no-op here.
